* **What Primac does:** Primac delivers **integrated vibration and condition monitoring solutions** for the maintenance and reliability of **critical rotating machinery**. The goal is to **reduce downtime and in-service failures** and **increase profitability** for industrial clients. [Primac](https://www.primac.ca/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
* **Industry:** Mechanical / industrial engineering, focused on **reliability engineering, condition monitoring, vibration analysis, predictive maintenance, and balancing** of rotating equipment. [Frasers Directory+1](https://www.frasersdirectory.com/suppliers/primac-reliability-consultants-ltd-16573654180/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
* **Company scale & history:** Independent Canadian company, founded in the early 1990s (around 1993), with 30+ years of experience and a team of 10–50 specialized staff. [Primac+1](https://www.primac.ca/careers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **6\. Vocabulary & Phrasing**

### **6.1 Preferred phrases**

Use these types of phrases regularly:

* “integrated vibration and condition monitoring solutions”  
* “critical rotating machinery” or “critical assets”  
* “condition-based” or “predictive maintenance”  
* “proven track record of troubleshooting machinery problems quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively”

You may slightly paraphrase the site’s language, but keep this **lexical flavour**.

### **6.2 Service names & categories**

Use consistent naming:

* Condition Monitoring & Vibration Analysis  
* Multi-Channel Monitoring  
* Motion Amplification  
* Troubleshooting & Diagnostics  
* Natural Frequency / Resonance / ODS / Modal Analysis

### **6.3 Things to avoid or minimize**

* Over-casual language (“we’re crazy about uptime”, “we geek out on vibrations”)  
* Empty marketing buzzwords without specifics (“synergy”, “world-class” used alone)  
* Overly narrow geography statements: avoid “only Western Canada” or “exclusively Western Canada”. Instead: “based in Western Canada, serving clients across Canada and beyond,” when needed.

## **7\. Style & Formatting Rules**

### **7.1 Headings & structure**

* Use **clear headings** for sections:  
  * Website: Sentence-case or Title Case (e.g., “Condition Monitoring & Vibration Analysis”)  
  * Proposal-style: UPPERCASE headings (e.g., “SCOPE OF WORK”, “SUMMARY”) are acceptable.  
* Break longer content into:  
  * **Overview → Benefits → How It Works → Deliverables → Call-to-Action**

### **7.2 Bullets vs paragraphs**

* Use **bullets** for:  
  * Lists of services, capabilities or steps  
  * Benefits / outcomes  
  * Assumptions and requirements  
* Start bullets with **strong verbs**: “Provide”, “Perform”, “Monitor”, “Assist”, “Design”, “Develop”, “Review”.

### **7.3 Sentence & paragraph length**

* **Website hero / intros:** 1–2 short sentences, 6–20 words each.  
* **Body copy:** Mix of short and medium sentences (10–25 words). Avoid long, winding 40+ word sentences.  
* Paragraphs should be compact (2–5 sentences).

### **7.4 Tense & modality**

* Describe services mostly in **present tense** (“Primac delivers…”, “We provide…”) or **future tense** for proposal-style (“Primac will provide…”, “We will perform…”).  
* Use modal verbs to set expectations carefully: “can”, “will typically”, “is designed to”. Avoid absolute promises of outcomes.
